This is a Flask app which that is used alongside TikTok for web or desktop.

The form enables a researcher to code videos that they have just watched (including date and time) for certain content within the videos. In this case, it is mentions of steroids and the advertising of the sale of steroids. But it could be changed and used to record mentions of any other kind of content.

It writes to an Excel file, automatically recording the date and time.

This would then work in conjuction with a TikTok data request on the app, which records the date and time of every video watched, as well as the URL. This would then enable the reesearcher to cross reference / combine the datasets to provide a URL for each of the coded videos.

The benefit of this is that it can ensure that the researcher is not copy and pasting each link into a spreadsheet, which would be time consuming and also could potentially undermine the analysis of TikTok's recommendation algorithm, as it would amount to the researcher not behaving in a "normal" way on the app.
